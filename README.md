  **Goldback Conjecture**
  
Goldbach's Conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all
of mathematics. It states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two
primes. The conjecture has been shown to hold for all integers less than 4 Ã— 1018, but remains unproven
despite considerable effort.
Test Goldbach's Conjecture on for all integers less than one hundred. For each integer, print out a single
line showing how two primes can sum to the integer. 

For example:

  ```
  4 = 2 + 2
  6 = 3 + 3
  8 = 3 + 5
  ```
